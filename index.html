            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Fraterne front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. 
                I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. 
                When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but can adapt to whatever tools are required. 
                I'm based in London, UK, but I'm happy working remotely and have experience in remote teams.
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me outdoors.
                I love being out in nature whether that's going for a walk, run or cycling. I'd love you to check out my work.
                As a Junior Front-End Developer at [Company Name], I was integrated into the technical team to contribute to the development of [Project Name]. 
                My primary objective was to bridge the gap between creative design and technical implementation. Working in an Agile/Scrum environment, I focused on building high-performance, 
                user-centric interfaces while ensuring code maintainability and scalability.
